Intended Logic:
The code is trying to find the maximum number in a list by comparing each element with the current maximum value. If an element is greater than the current maximum, it becomes the new maximum. The function raises a ValueError if the input list is empty.

Errors:
1. The function fails to handle empty lists correctly. Instead of raising a ValueError, it returns the first element of the list as the maximum value. This is because the condition `if not arr:` checks whether the length of the list is zero, but it does not check if the list itself is empty.
2. The function does not handle lists with only one element correctly. In this case, the function will return the same element as the maximum value without comparing it with any other elements.
3. The function does not handle negative numbers correctly. If a list contains both positive and negative numbers, the function may return an incorrect result because it only compares adjacent elements.

Conceptual Feedback:
To fix these errors, we need to modify the code to check for empty lists properly and handle single-element lists correctly. We can also add a check for negative numbers to ensure that the maximum value is correct.

Fix Suggestion:
Here's a corrected version of the function that handles empty lists, single-element lists, and negative numbers correctly:
```
def find_max(arr):
    if not arr:
        raise ValueError("Input list is empty.")
    max_val = arr[0]
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        num = arr[i]
        if num > max_val:
            max_val = num
    return max_val
```
