Intended Logic:
The code is trying to find the maximum number in a list by comparing each element with the previously found maximum value. It starts by initializing the maximum value as the first element of the list, and then iterates through the rest of the elements, comparing them with the current maximum value and updating it if necessary. The function returns the final maximum value after completing the comparison for all the elements in the list.

Errors:
The code will fail to handle edge cases such as an empty list or a list with only one element. If the input list is empty, the program will raise a ValueError due to trying to access the first element of an empty list. Similarly, if the input list has only one element, the program will return that element as the maximum value even though it may not be the actual maximum value in the list.

Conceptual Feedback:
The code is a good start, but there are some improvements that can be made to handle edge cases and provide better performance. One way to fix this issue is by adding a check for an empty list before starting the comparison loop. Another improvement could be to use a more efficient algorithm such as sorting the list first and then accessing the last element, which would provide faster performance for larger lists.

Fix Suggestion:
Here's a corrected version of the code that handles edge cases better and provides better performance:
```python
def find_max(arr):
    if not arr:
        raise ValueError("List is empty")
    max_val = arr[0]
    for num in arr:
        if num > max_val:
            max_val = num
    return max_val
```
