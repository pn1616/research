Intended Logic: The given code is a recursive function named `factorial(n)` that computes the factorial of an input number `n`. The function returns 1 for `n = 0`, and recursively computes the product for positive integers.

Errors: There are no obvious errors in the code snippet provided. However, there is a potential edge case not handled in the code: `factorial(0)` does not return 1 when `n` is an integer less than or equal to 0.

Conceptual Feedback: The function correctly handles positive integers by recursively calling itself with the argument `n - 1`. However, it does not handle negative numbers, which can cause errors if used as input. Additionally, there is no base case for when `n = 0` and `n < 0`, which means that the function will infinitely recurse without returning any result.

Fix Suggestion: To fix the edge case of `factorial(0)` not returning 1, we can add a separate if statement to check for this condition before calling the recursive function:
```
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    elif n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Negative numbers are not allowed")
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)
```
This function now handles negative numbers by raising a `ValueError` and correctly returns 1 for `factorial(0)`.
