Intended Logic:
The code is trying to sort a list of integers in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm. The function takes an array as input and returns the sorted array.

Errors:
The code fails to handle edge cases such as empty arrays, negative numbers, or non-integer values in the list. It also does not correctly handle the case where the list is already sorted.

Conceptual Feedback:
There are several issues with the code that make it difficult to understand and debug. Firstly, the function name "bubble_sort" is not descriptive enough. A better name for the function would be "bubbleSort" or "sortedBubble". Secondly, the variable names used in the function do not clearly indicate their purpose. For example, the variable "n" is not clearly related to the number of elements in the array, while "i" and "j" are not related to the index of the current element being processed. This makes it difficult for readers to understand the code's logic.

Fix Suggestion:
The corrected version of the code with a more descriptive function name and clear variable names would be as follows:
```
def sorted_bubble(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
    return arr
```
This version of the code is more readable and easier to understand, as the variable names clearly indicate their purpose. Additionally, the function name "sorted_bubble" clearly conveys its intention to sort an array using bubble sort algorithm.
