Intended Logic:
The function `reverse_array` takes a list of integers as input, and reverses the order of the elements in-place. It does this by iteratively swapping each element with its predecessor until the entire list is reversed.

Errors:
There are no obvious errors in the code snippet provided. However, there is one potential issue that could arise: if the input list contains any duplicate elements, the function may not reverse the list correctly because it only swaps each element with its predecessor once. To handle this case, a slight modification to the code would be needed to ensure that every element in the list is properly reversed.

Conceptual Feedback:
The function looks like it should work correctly for all inputs except those containing duplicate elements. The use of two indices (`left` and `right`) to keep track of where to swap the next two elements allows for efficient reversing of the list, but may not handle duplicates properly if not implemented correctly.

Fix Suggestion:
To fix this issue, we can modify the code by keeping track of both the current element and its predecessor in a new data structure (e.g., a set). This would allow us to ensure that every element in the list is reversed at most once, even if there are duplicates. Here's an example of how this could be implemented:
```python
def reverse_array(arr):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    seen = set()
    while left < right:
        if arr[left] in seen or arr[right] in seen:
            # Skip duplicates
            left += 1
            right -= 1
            continue
        seen.add(arr[left])
        seen.add(arr[right])
        arr[left], arr[right] = arr[right], arr[left]
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    return arr
```
