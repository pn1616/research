Intended Logic:
The code is trying to reverse a list of integers in place without using any extra memory. It does this by returning the list with the index step set to -1, which reverses the order of the elements in the list.

Errors:
The code fails to handle edge cases such as empty lists or lists with only one element. If the input list is an empty list, the function will return an empty list instead of raising a ValueError. Similarly, if the input list has only one element, the function will return the original list instead of returning a reversed version of it.

Conceptual Feedback:
The code is using the indexing syntax to access and modify the elements of the list in place, but it's not handling the edge cases correctly. It should raise a ValueError for empty lists or lists with only one element instead of returning an empty list or the original list. Additionally, the function should return a new reversed version of the list instead of modifying the original list in-place.

Fix Suggestion:
Here's a corrected version of the code that handles edge cases correctly and returns a new reversed version of the list:
```
def reverse_array(arr):
    if len(arr) == 0:
        raise ValueError("List is empty")
    elif len(arr) == 1:
        return arr
    else:
        return arr[::-1]
```
