Intended Logic:
The code is trying to check if the input string is a case-insensitive palindrome by comparing it with its reversed version.

Errors:
1. The code does not handle non-alphanumeric characters properly. For example, if the input string contains spaces or special characters, it may not work correctly.
2. The code assumes that all strings are ASCII encoded, which may not be true for all languages. It would be better to use unicode encoding to ensure correct handling of all characters.
3. The code does not handle numbers properly. For example, if the input string contains a number such as "1234", it will not work correctly because it is comparing an integer with a string.

Conceptual Feedback:
The code is trying to compare the input string with its reversed version using the == operator. However, this does not handle non-alphanumeric characters properly and assumes that all strings are ASCII encoded. Additionally, it does not handle numbers properly.

Fix Suggestion:
1. To handle non-alphanumeric characters, you can use the unicode encoding to ensure correct handling of all characters. For example, you can use the following code:
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s.lower().encode('ascii', 'ignore') == s[::-1].lower().encode('ascii', 'ignore')
```
This will remove any non-alphanumeric characters from the input string before comparing it with its reversed version.
2. To handle numbers properly, you can use a different approach such as converting the number to a string and then comparing it with the reversed string. For example:
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s.lower().encode('ascii', 'ignore') == str(int(s[::-1]))
```
This will convert the number to a string before comparing it with the reversed string, which will ensure that numbers are handled correctly.
3. To handle all cases, you can use a combination of the above suggestions:
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    s = s.lower().encode('ascii', 'ignore')
    return s == str(int(s[::-1]))
```
This will remove any non-alphanumeric characters from the input string, convert all numbers to strings, and then compare it with its reversed version.
